# Discord Avatar Decoration Bot

This is a Discord bot that allows users to decorate their avatars with unique visual effects. The bot is built using [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/), [canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas), and [gif-encoder-2](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gif-encoder-2). The effects are provided in the `effects.json` file, and users can select them via a slash command to apply to their avatars.

## Features

- Select from a variety of visual effects to decorate your avatar.
- The bot generates a GIF with the chosen effect and sends it back to the user.
- Handles different categories of effects with emoji representation.
- Designed to be extensible and easy to configure.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
- A Discord bot token. You can get one by creating a bot on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/wickstudio/discord-avatar-decoration-bot.git
   cd discord-avatar-decoration-bot
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure the bot by creating a `config.js` file in the root directory and adding your Discord bot token and guild ID:

     token: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN"
   };
   ```

4. Create a `effects.json` file in the root directory to define the available effects. Here is an example:

   [
     {
       "id": "1232071069268049920",

       "emoji": "<emoji_1232071069268049920:1238864757491109889>"
     },
     ...
   ]
   ```
